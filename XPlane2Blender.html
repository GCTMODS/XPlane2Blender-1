<h2>Scenery &amp; Cockpit import/export scripts for Blender</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>
is an open source 3D object editor for Windows, Mac and
UNIX.</p>
<p>These Blender scripts export scenery created in Blender
to X-Plane v7, v8 or CSL <code>.obj</code> format.</p>
<p>The scripts also import existing X-Plane v6, v7, v8 and CSL
<code>.obj</code> scenery files and X-Plane v7 and v8 <code>.acf</code>
airplanes into Blender.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Runs on Windows 98 or later, Mac OS 10.3.9 or later, and Linux.</p>
<p>Requires <a href="http://www.blender.org/Download/">Blender 2.43</a> or later.<br>
<small>Mac OS users should download the default "Python 2.3" build of Blender
unless you have installed Python 2.5.<br>
Linux users should download the build that corresponds to the Python
version installed on your system.</small></p>
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>This document is a reference and assumes familiarity
with Blender. You may find it easier to get started using the following
tutorials, and come back to this document later:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/tutorials.html">Using Blender to create X-Plane scenery</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.blender.org/tutorials-help/tutorials/tutorial-folder/blender-user-interface-tutorial/">Blender User Interface</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D/Noob_to_Pro">Blender3D: Noob to Pro</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Run Blender to check that it is installed correctly. If the Blender window appears "blurry" turn off anti-aliasing in your video card's OpenGL settings and re-start Blender.</p>
<p>Now close Blender.</p>

<p>(Re)start Blender. This file can now be viewed by choosing
<samp>Help&nbsp;&rarr; X-Plane</samp> in Blender.</p>
<p>You can now delete the temporary folder.</p>

<h3>Importing objects</h3>
<p>First, move the 3D Cursor to where you want the imported object
to be placed. Usually you'll want the object to be placed at the origin so
just press <samp style="font-weight: bold;">Shift&nbsp;C</samp>
to centre the 3D Cursor at the origin.</p>
<p>Choose <samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Import&nbsp;&rarr; X-Plane Object</samp>,
select a <code>.obj</code> file and press <samp>Import&nbsp;OBJ</samp>.</p>
<p>The scenery is imported at the 3D Cursor position.</p>
<p>You can import multiple <code>.obj</code> files and re-export them as a
single file. But note that the X-Plane <code>.obj</code>
file format only supports the use of one texture file, so you'll have
to create a single larger file containg all required textures.
You can create this single file automatically by selecting all the objects
and, in a <samp>UV/Image Editor</samp> window, choosing
<samp>Image&nbsp;&rarr; Consolidate&nbsp;into&nbsp;one&nbsp;image</samp>.</p>

<h3>Importing planes</h3>
<p>First, move the 3D Cursor to where you want the imported plane or weapon
to be placed. Usually you'll want it to be placed at the origin so
just press <samp style="font-weight: bold;">Shift&nbsp;C</samp>
to centre the 3D Cursor at the origin.</p>
<p>Choose
<samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Import&nbsp;&rarr; X-Plane&nbsp;Plane&nbsp;or&nbsp;Weapon</samp>
and choose whether to import the plane or weapon so that the "reference point"
is located at the 3D Cursor (for making cockpit & misc objects) or so that the
"centre of gravity" is located at the 3D Cursor (for making CSLs and static
scenery).</p>
<p>Then select a <code>.acf</code> or <code>.wpn</code> file and press
<samp>Import&nbsp;ACF&nbsp;or&nbsp;WPN</samp>.</p>
<p>The script creates up to three versions of the plane or weapon in
Blender, one in each of layers 1, 2 and 3. The versions in layers 2 and
3 use approximately
<small><sup>1</sup></small>/<small><sub>10</sub><sup>th</sup></small> and
<small><sup>1</sup></small>/<small><sub>100</sub><sup>th</sup></small>
of the number of faces compared to the version in layer 1.
See <a href="#Level_Of_Detail">Level of Detail</a> below for an
explanation of why it does this.</p>
<p>Imported planes need some tweaking before you can export them
as scenery or as a CSL object; see <a href="#Tweaking_planes">Tweaking
planes</a> below.</p>

<h3>Exporting objects</h3>
<p>First, choose <samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Save As&#8230;</samp> and save the
<code>.blend</code> file in the aircraft or scenery folder where you want
the <code>.obj</code> file to end up. Then choose:
<dl>
  <dd><samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Export&nbsp;&rarr; X-Plane&nbsp;CSL&nbsp;Object</samp> or</dd>
  <dd><samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Export&nbsp;&rarr; X-Plane&nbsp;v7&nbsp;Object</samp> or</dd>
  <dd><samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Export&nbsp;&rarr; X-Plane&nbsp;v8&nbsp;Object</samp></dd>
</dl>
<p>The object is exported in the same folder and with the same name
as the current Blender file, but with a <code>.obj</code> extension. 
Blender may display some informational messages - click on one of these
messages to see which object(s) the message refers to.</p>
<p>If there is an error then the scripts will attempt to identify and
highlight the offending Blender object(s).</p>
<p><samp><b>csl: </b></samp>These objects are intended for use with
multi-user plugins such as
<a href="http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xsb/">XSquawkBox</a> or
<a href="http://www.ivao.aero/softdev/X-IvAp/">X-IvAp</a>.</p>
<p><samp><b>v8: </b></samp>These objects are supported by X-Plane versions 8.20 and later.</p>

<h3>Creating X-Plane scenery</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Find and open the<code> Custom&nbsp;Scenery </code>folder
inside of your <code>X-Plane</code> installation.</li>
  <li>Create a subfolder with the name of the scenery package that you're making.</li>
  <li>Save your Blender file in this subfolder folder with a descriptive name, <i>eg</i>:
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>X-Plane&nbsp;8.50\Custom&nbsp;Scenery\EGLL\house.blend</code></div>
The X-Plane <code>.obj</code> file will be exported to the same place, <i>ie</i>:
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>X-Plane&nbsp;8.50\Custom&nbsp;Scenery\EGLL\house.obj</code></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Tweaking_planes"></a>Tweaking planes</h4>
<p>Imported planes need to be positioned correctly on the ground for
use as static scenery (don't do this if you're making a CSL or cockpit
object):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select layers 1-3, select all objects and position the
plane so that its undercarriage is sitting directly on the ground
(represented by the <i>x</i>/y axes).</li>
  <li>You may also need to rotate the plane slightly so that all
wheels are level; press <samp style="font-weight: bold;">r</samp>
and move the mouse to <u>r</u>otate the plane so that its
undercarriage is sitting directly on the ground.
Click to set the plane's position.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary file for textures is named
<code><i>airplane</i>_paint</code>.
Most planes also use textures from a secondary file named
<code><i>airplane</i>_paint2</code>. Objects that use textures from
the secondary file are imported with "<code>*</code>" after their
name to make them easier to identify in Blender's <samp>Outliner</samp>
window.</p>
<p>The X-Plane <code>.obj</code> scenery file formats only support the use
of a single file for textures, up to 1024x1024 pixels in size.
If your plane only has a few simple objects that use textures from
<code><i>airplane</i>_paint2</code> then you should re-texture these objects
to use <code><i>airplane</i>_paint</code>, following the same procedure
described below for weapons and misc objects. If that is not feasible
you can use this procedure to make the plane use textures from a single
file:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Save your Blender model.</li>
  <li>In an image editor program, resize <code><i>airplane</i>_paint</code>
and <code><i>airplane</i>_paint2</code> to 512x512. <small>(You don't need to
save these resized versions)</small>.</li>
  <li>Create a new bitmap file 1024 pixels wide and 512 pixels high.</li>
  <li>Paste the resized <code><i>airplane</i>_paint</code> into the left half of this bitmap.</li>
  <li>Paste the resized <code><i>airplane</i>_paint2</code> into the right half of this bitmap.</li>
  <li>Save the bitmap file in the same folder and with the same name as your <code>.blend</code> file. If you're making a CSL object then you must save in PNG format.</li>
  <li>If your plane uses night-time textures then repeat this procedure for the <code>_LIT</code> bitmap files.</li>
  <li>In a Blender <samp>UV/Image Editor</samp> window choose
<samp>Image&nbsp;&rarr; Merge&nbsp;_paint&nbsp;and&nbsp;_paint2</samp>.
</ul>      
<p>If your imported plane uses weapons or misc objects then each of
these will use an additional bitmap file. Weapons are imported
with their names starting with "<code>W<i>nn</i></code>" and objects
with their names starting with "<code>O<i>nn</i></code>". Also note
that reduced-LOD versions of weapons and misc objects may be present in
layers 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Open an <samp>Outliner</samp> window and choose
<samp>View&nbsp;&rarr; Show&nbsp;Outliner</samp>. For each mesh that has a
name starting with "<code>W<i>nn</i></code>" or "<code>O<i>nn</i></code>" or
ending with "<code>*</code>", either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete the mesh, or</li>
  <li>Copy the required textures to an unused area in
the primary bitmap file and use the <samp>UV Image Editor</samp>
window to map the new copy of the textures to the mesh's faces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider performance issues when the plane is rendered in
X-Plane. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most important: Do you really need fully detailed 1024x1024
textures for your plane? Video memory is used up by terrain and
object geometry and textures. Once you run out of video memory the GPU
has to fall back to main memory, and this <u>really</u> slows things
down. One 1024x1024 texture uses 4MB of video memory. Some people are
running X-Plane on computers with only 32MB of video memory, so one
1024x1024 texture at "extreme res" in X-Plane uses
<small><sup>1</sup></small>/<small><sub>8</sub><sup>th</sup></small>
of their video memory. Consider resizing the texture file in an image
editor program to half or even quarter size.
Use <samp>Image&nbsp;&rarr; Replace</samp> to use the new texture file.</li>
  <li>Does the model have hidden faces? Some versions of X-Plane
don't handle hidden faces in v7 scenery objects very well and they also
a cause a small performance hit. Look for things like wings or misc
bodies that are partially or wholly buried in the fuselage and delete
any wholly hidden faces before exporting.</li>
  <li>Do you really need all that detail? Consider deleting
details like flap tracks, antennae etc before exporting. This
especially goes for the lower <a href="XPlane2Blender.html#Level_Of_Detail">Level of Detail</a>
versions of the plane in layers 2 and 3 which are only viewed in
X-Plane from &gt;1000m and &gt;4000m respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating 3D cockpits</h3>
<p>X-Plane 3D cockpits are just normal v7 or v8 scenery objects.
However cockpits can't contain multiple <a href="#Level_Of_Detail">Levels
of Detail</a>, so only objects in Blender layer 1 are exported.
If you want to keep objects in your Blender scene for reference but
which you don't want to export - eg the plane fuselage - then put them
in layer 4 or greater before exporting.</p>
<p>Choose <samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Save As</samp> and save
the blender file in the same folder as your plane's <code>.acf</code>
file with the name <code><i>airplane</i>_cockpit.blend</code>,
where <i>airplane</i> is the name of your plane's <code>.acf</code>
file.</p>
<p>Normally you will want to import your plane into Blender to
act as a reference and/or starting point for your cockpit. Delete any
plane parts that you don't need in creating your cockpit - you only
need to keep the fuselage itself plus any relevant Misc Bodies. After
import, your cockpit uses the same texture file as your plane, ie <code><i>airplane</i>_paint</code>.
Choose <samp>Image&nbsp;&rarr; Replace </samp> in a
<samp>UV Image Editor</samp> window to use a different texture file, which
can be named anything you like (but no spaces) and which should live in
the same folder as your plane's <code>.acf</code> file.</p>
<p>To construct moving cockpit instruments in X-Plane v8:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Layout the 2D panel in PlaneMaker as normal. But bear in
mind that only the top 768 lines of the 2D panel can be used in the 3D
cockpit in X-Plane versions prior to 8.20.</li>
  <li>Run X-Plane and load your aircraft. Press the <samp style="font-weight: bold;">Up</samp> arrow to ensure
that you're looking at the top of the 2D panel. Take a screenshot (on a
PC press <samp style="font-weight: bold;">Alt&nbsp;PrtSc</samp>).</li>
  <li>Load the screenshot into an image editor and change its
size so that it's the same size as your 2D panel (typically 1024x1024)
- don't resize the screenshot, just add blank space. Save the
screenshot as <code>ScreenshotPanel.png</code> (or any
filename ending in <code>*panel.*</code>) in the same
folder as your plane's <code>.acf</code> file.</li>
  <li>Use the <code>ScreenshotPanel.png</code>
texture on those faces that you want to display moving cockpit
instruments in X-Plane. (It's easier to use this screenshot texture
instead of the real panel texture while editing in Blender, since the
screenshot has instruments drawn on it). The screenshot file does not
need to be distributed with your finished plane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that X-Plane versions prior to 8.20 only display the 3D
cockpit when running at the default 1024x768 resolution. You may want
to mention this in the Readme with your plane if your plane is
intended to work in X-Plane versions prior to 8.20.</p>

<h3>Using Blender to create X-Plane objects</h3>
<p>Only Lamps and Meshes are exported to X-Plane.
You can use other Blender object types, <i>eg</i> Curves and Surfaces,
to construct your scenery as long as you convert them to meshes before
exporting to X-Plane.</p>
<h4><a name="lamps">Lamps</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Only Lamp objects of type "Lamp" are exported to X-Plane. Lamp objects
of types "Area", "Spot", "Semi" and "Hemi" are ignored (and so can be
used to illuminate your model in Blender).</li>
  <li>Lamp objects with certain words in their names have special behaviours when exported to an X-Plane v8 object:
    <dl>
      <dd><code>Lamp</code> - Normal (legacy) light. The colour is determined by the R,G,B settings in the <samp>Lamp</samp> Shading panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F5</samp>).</dd>
      <dd><code>Flash</code> - Flashing (legacy) light. The colour is determined by the R,G,B settings in the <samp>Lamp</samp> Shading panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F5</samp>).</dd>
      <dd><code>Pulse</code>, <code>Strobe</code>, <code>Traffic</code>, <code>smoke_black</code>, <code>smoke_white</code>  -
As for X-Plane v7 objects; see below. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><i>other</i> -
X-Plane pre-defined "named" or "custom" light. (Supported by X-Plane 8.50 and later. R,G,B settings are ignored). The name of the X-Plane light is taken from the value of a <a href="#properties">property</a> named <code>name</code> if this exists, otherwise from the name of the lamp object.</dd>
    </dl></li>
  <li>Lamp objects with certain words in their names have special behaviours when exported to an X-Plane v7 object:
    <dl>
      <dd><code>Flash</code> - Flashing light. The colour is determined by the R,G,B settings in the <samp>Lamp</samp> Shading panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F5</samp>).</dd>
      <dd><code>Pulse</code> or <code>airplane_beacon</code> - Red pulsing anti-collision light. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>Strobe</code> or <code>airplane_strobe</code> - White strobe light. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>Traffic</code> - Cycles red, orange, green. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>smoke_black</code> or <code>smoke_white</code> - Not really a light; emits smoke. The size of the smoke puffs is determined by the Energy setting in the <samp>Lamp</samp> Shading panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F5</samp>) (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><i>other</i> - Normal light. The colour is determined by the R,G,B settings in the <samp>Lamp</samp> Shading panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F5</samp>).</dd>
    </dl></li>
  <li>Lamp objects with certain names have special behaviours when exported to
an X-Plane CSL object. The XSquawkBox documentation strongly recommends
that you use these special lights:
    <dl>
      <dd><code>airplane_landing</code> - White landing light. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>airplane_taxi</code> - White taxi light. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>airplane_nav_left</code> - Red navigation/position light. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>airplane_nav_right</code> - Green navigation/position light. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>airplane_beacon</code> - Red pulsing anti-collision light, on when engines are running. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>airplane_strobe</code> - White strobe light. (R,G,B settings are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><i>other</i> - Normal light. The colour is determined by the R,G,B settings in the <samp>Lamp</samp> Shading panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F5</samp>).</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Meshes"></a>Meshes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create faces with 3 or 4 edges (called "<code>tri</code>"s
and "<code>quad</code>"s in X-Plane).</li>
  <li>In the <samp>Link and Materials</samp> Editing panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F9</samp>):
    <ul>
      <li><samp>Set Smooth</samp> and <samp>Set Solid</samp> control whether
to smooth edges of faces in a mesh.
This is useful when using multiple faces to simulate a curved surface.
Go to "Object Mode", select the mesh and press <samp>Set Smooth</samp>.
The effect is only visible in Blender <samp>3D View</samp>
windows when the <samp>Viewport Shading</samp> button is
set to <samp>Solid</samp> or <samp>Shaded</samp>.<br>
      <samp style="font-weight: bold;">v7: </samp>Only faces that
are part of a <a href="#strips">Strip</a> will be smoothed when displayed
in X-Plane.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the <samp>Texture Face</samp> Editing panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F9</samp>) available in <samp>UV Face Select</samp> mode:
    <ul>
      <li><samp>Tex</samp> button controls whether the face has a texture:<br>
In an image editor application create one texture file that is like a
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage" target="_blank">collage</a>"
of all of the textures that you need in your model. 
The height and width of the texture file must be powers of two
(<i>eg</i> 128, 256, 512, 1024) but it doesn't have to be square.
(See <code>&#8230;/Custom&nbsp;Scenery/KSBD&nbsp;Demo&nbsp;Area/KSBD_example.png</code> for an example).<br>
Save the texture file in 32bit or 24bit PNG format (<i>ie</i> with or
without an "Alpha" channel) in the aircraft or scenery folder where you
want the X-Plane <code>.obj</code> file to end up.<br>
Use the <samp>UV Image Editor</samp> window to control mapping of the textures
to the face.</li>
      <li><samp>Tiles</samp> button controls whether
the face is rendered with "polygon offsetting" (<code>ATTR_poly_os</code>)
in X-Plane. Press this button for faces that lie flat on the ground to prevent
Z-buffer thrashing in X-Plane. Don't press this button for other faces.
For best results with X-Plane versions prior to 8.50 you should ensure that
objects that use polygon offsetting are listed first in your <code>.env</code>
or <code>.dsf</code> scenery file.<br>
      <samp style="font-weight: bold;">v7: </samp>"polygon offsetting" does not produce reliable results in X-Plane versions prior to 8.20.<br>
      <samp style="font-weight: bold;">csl: </samp>This button has no effect when exporting CSL objects.</li>
      <li><samp>Collision</samp> button indicates
that the face is <u>not</u> "hard" (ie not "landable on")
in X-Plane. Making faces hard is very expensive, so this button should
normally be pressed. Unpress this button only for things like
helicopter landing pads.<br>
<small>(Note: The meaning of this button was changed in v1.50.
Use <a href="http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/collide.txt">this</a>
script to turn the Collision button back on for all faces).</small><br>
      <samp style="font-weight: bold;">v8: </samp>You can specify
the type of hard surface. Add a <a href="#properties">property</a> named <code>surface</code> and give it the value <code>water</code>, <code>concrete</code>, <code>asphalt</code>, <code>grass</code>, <code>dirt</code>, <code>gravel</code>, <code>lakebed</code>, <code>snow</code>, <code>shoulder</code> or <code>blastpad</code>. The surface type is ignored by X-Plane versions prior to 8.50.<br>
      <samp style="font-weight: bold;">v7: </samp>Only faces with
4 edges (ie "<code>quads</code>") are exported as "hard".<br>
      <samp style="font-weight: bold;">v7: </samp>X-Plane
versions prior to 8.20 have a bug where <code>.obj</code>
files that contain hard faces must be placed in WorldMaker with an
"object heading" of 0. Otherwise the "hard" part of the surface ends
up in the wrong place.<br>
      <samp style="font-weight: bold;">csl: </samp>This button has no effect when exporting CSL objects.</li>
      <li><samp>Twoside</samp> button controls whether one or both sides
of the face are displayed. Unless you have a lot of double-sided faces it
is cheaper to avoid this button and to use two single-sided faces
back-to-back instead.</li>
      <li><samp>Alpha</samp> button is a hint to Blender and to X-Plane that
the face is transparent or translucent. Use this for outwards-facing
transparent or translucent faces to instruct X-Plane to draw these
faces last so that you can see other faces through them.
Don't press this button for opaque (normal) faces.
See <a href="#order">drawing order</a> for more fine-grained control
over drawing order.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><samp style="font-weight: bold;">v8: </samp>In
the <samp>Material buttons</samp> Shading panels
(<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F5</samp>) you can change the way that
the mesh reacts to light by specifying a material. Changing between materials
in X-Plane is expensive so you should ensure that you only use a few materials
in your model.
Press <samp>Add New</samp> to create a new material, or choose an existing
material (if any) from the drop-down list.
Only a few of the Blender's many material buttons affect X-Plane:
    <ul>
      <li><samp>Col</samp> button and the
<samp>R</samp>,<samp>G</samp>,<samp>B</samp> sliders on the
<samp>Material</samp> panel control the diffuse colour of the faces.
X-Plane combines the colours that are specified by the texture (if any) with
this setting.
The default X-Plane setting is <code>1</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>1</code>
(white). However the default setting of a new material in Blender is
<code>0.8</code>, <code>0.8</code>, <code>0.8</code>.</li>
      <li><samp>Spec</samp> slider on the <samp>Shaders</samp> panel
controls the specularity (shininess) of the faces.
The default X-Plane setting is 0 (matt).
However the default setting of a new material in Blender is 0.5.</li>
      <li><samp>Emit</samp> slider on the <samp>Shaders</samp> panel
controls the emissive brightness of the faces. Emissive faces give off
light so the effects of this setting are most obvious at night.
It is usually cheaper and easy to use <code>_LIT</code> textures to control
night-time brightness instead of using this setting.
However using this setting allows you to create faces that also give off light
during the daytime, <i>eg</i> on overcast days,
which <code>_LIT</code> textures do not.
The default X-Plane and Blender setting is 0 (not emissive).</li>
      <li><samp>Mir</samp> button and the
<samp>R</samp>,<samp>G</samp>,<samp>B</samp> sliders on the
<samp>Material</samp> panel control the emissive colour of the faces.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>      
</ul>
<p>Use <a href="http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/normalise.txt">this</a>
script if you need to reset all faces in the scene to standard settings
<small>(<i>ie</i> no polygon offsetting, not hard,
single sided, not transparent)</small>.</p>
<h4>Lines</h4>
<p>Blender doesn't support Lines directly. Use a mesh with one
4-edged face instead. The pair of vertices at each end of the "line"
must be within 0.1 units of each other. The face must be the only face
in its mesh and must not have a texture assigned to it.</p>
<p>Assign a material to the face and use the
<samp>Col</samp> button and the <samp>R</samp>,<samp>G</samp>,<samp>B</samp>
sliders on the <samp>Material</samp> panel to control
the colour of the line.
Faces not linked to a material will be exported coloured grey.</p>
<h4><a name="animation"><font size="+1">v8: </font>Animation</a></h4>
<p>You can make lamps, meshes and lines animate in X-Plane
according to the value of any of the simulator datarefs
listed <a href="http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.html">here</a>
that have type "int", "float" or "double".</p>
<p>Create an "Armature" object. Click on the armature's "Bone" and in the
<samp>Armature Bones</samp> panel (which is only displayed in
<samp>Edit Mode</samp>) name the bone with one of the datarefs in
<a href="http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.html">this list</a>.
For datarefs that are listed as being of type <code>int[<i>n</i>]</code> or
<code>float[<i>n</i>]</code> append <code>[0]</code>
to the bone name to use the first value, <code>[1]</code> to use the second
value etc. <i>eg</i> name the bone <code>ENGN_thro[0]</code>
to represent the throttle setting for the first engine.</p>
<p>Make the bone the parent of the lamps and/or meshes that you want to
animate:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the lamps and/or meshes (the "children")</li>
  <li>Shift-click on the armature</li>
  <li><b>Choose <samp>Pose Mode</samp> from the Mode menu</b></li>
  <li>Click on the bone (the "parent")</li>
  <li>Press <samp><b>Ctrl&nbsp;P</b></samp>
and select <samp>Bone</samp> from the popup menu</li>
</ul>
<p>Add additional bones to the armature and create parent/child relationships
between each bone (using the <samp>Armature Bones</samp> panel in
<samp>Edit Mode</samp>) if you need to use multiple datarefs to describe the
animation of lamps/meshes. Make the lamps/meshes the child of the "youngest"
bone in the chain.</p>
<p>Use frames 1 and 2 to represent the desired position of the lamps/meshes
at the minimum and maximum dataref values - X-Plane will
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">interpolate</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation">extrapolate</a>
linearly between these two positions
<small>(X-Plane's animation syntax is quite simple;
so don't use IPOcurves or any other advanced Blender animation
techniques since these will be ignored by the exporter - only the
positions in frames 1 and 2 are significant to X-Plane)</small>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select animation frame 1</li>
  <li>Click on the armature</li>
  <li>Choose <samp>Pose Mode</samp> from the Mode menu</li>
  <li>Click on a bone</li>
  <li>Move and/or rotate the bone<li>
  <li>Press <samp><b>i</b></samp> to insert a "<samp>LocRot</samp>" key</li>
  <li>Repeat for any other bones in the armature</li>
  <li>Select animation frame 2 and repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, X-Plane will display the meshes in the frame 1 position
when the dataref has a value of 0, and in the frame 2 position
when the dataref has a value of 1.
You can change these values by adding <a href="#properties">properties</a>
to the armature; name the property after the dataref and append
<code>_v1</code> to the name for the value corresponding to frame 1, or
<code>_v2</code> for the value corresponding to frame 2.
<i>eg</i> the yoke pitch dataref <code>yolk_pitch_ratio</code>
has values between -1 (forward) and +1 (back) in X-Plane; to make
X-Plane display the position in frame 1 when the yoke is pushed fully
forward add a property named <code>yolk_pitch_ratio<b>_v1</b></code>, and
give it the value <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use custom datarefs for animation (<i>ie</i> datarefs
supplied by a plugin that calls XPLMRegisterDataAccessor); name the bone
with the last part ("leaf") of the dataref name and add a
<a href="#properties">property</a> with that same "leaf" name. Set this
property's value to the rest of the dataref name.
<i>eg</i> the plugin registers the custom dataref
<code>my_org/widget/volume</code>; to use this dataref name the bone
<code>volume</code> and add a property named
<code>volume</code> with the string value <code>my_org/widget/</code>.</p>
<p>You can make all of the lamps and meshes in an animation disappear
when a dataref is within a certain range by adding a pair of
<a href="#properties">properties</a> to the armature named
<code><i>dataref</i>_hide_v1</code> and <code><i>dataref</i>_hide_v2</code>.
(It's OK to use datarefs that are not otherwise used in the animation).
You can make hidden lamps/meshes re-appear when a dataref is within
a certain range by adding a pair of properties named
<code><i>dataref</i>_show_v1</code> and <code><i>dataref</i>_show_v2</code>. 
The dataref that you use to "show" the animation can be the same or different
than the dataref that you used to "hide" the animation.</p>
<p>You can add multiple "hide" and "show" pairs of properties. To use
the same dataref in multiple "show" and "hide" properties name the
subsequent pairs of properties <code><i>dataref</i>_hide_v3</code> and
<code><i>dataref</i>_hide_v4</code> etc.
The order of "hide" and "show" properties is significant; the animation
will be hidden if any of the "hide" datarefs are in range, unless a subsequent
"show" dataref is also in range. <small>(The animation is always shown by
default, so you only need to use a pair of "show" properties if you have used
one or more pairs of "hide" properties and you want to override them).</small>

<p>You can make a bone the child of a bone in a different armature,
in which case any <code><i>dataref</i></code>, <code><i>dataref</i>_v1</code>
and <code><i>dataref</i>_v2</code> properties only apply to bones that are
in the same armature as the properties.
However all children inherit any "hide" and "show" properties from parent
armatures.</p>

<h4><a name="order"><font size="+1">v8: </font>Drawing order</a></h4>
<p>The order in which X-Plane draws the animations, lights, lines and
triangles in your scenery or cockpit object usually has no effect on
the appearance.
So the exporter optimises the order of animations, lights, lines and
triangles in your object to minimise the number of OpenGL state changes
and therefore maximise X-Plane's framerate.</p>
<p>However drawing order does become important if you use transparent and/or
translucent textures on some of your faces - transparent and translucent faces
must be drawn last, otherwise other faces will not be visible through
them. You should therefore tell Blender which faces are transparent/translucent
using the <samp>Alpha</samp> button in the <samp>Texture Face</samp> Editing
panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F9</samp>) in
<samp>UV Face Select</samp> mode. The exporter will ensure that X-Plane
draws these faces last.</p>
<p>But sometimes you need even more control over the drawing order -
<i>eg</i> modelling a cockpit with a transparent HUD and
(obviously) a transparent canopy; the HUD must be drawn after the canopy.</p>
<p>You can specify the relative order in which lamps, meshes etc should be
drawn by assigning them to "Groups" on the <samp>Object and links</samp>
panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F7</samp>):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objects that don't belong to a group are drawn first.</li>
  <li>The groups are sorted by alphabetical order, and then
    <ul>
      <li>objects that belong to the first group are drawn next.<br>
      &#8230;</li>
      <li>objects that belong to the last group are drawn last.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
<p><i>eg</i> in the case of the cockpit with transparent canopy and HUD,
we could put the canopy and HUD into separate groups named <code>GroupA</code>
and <code>GroupB</code> resepctively. Since <code>A</code> is before
<code>B</code> in the alphabet, the canopy would be drawn before the HUD
(and both would be drawn after the rest of the cockpit).</p>
<p>To add objects to a new group:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select the meshes that you want to be drawn late.</li>
  <li>Press the <samp>Add to Group</samp> button on the
<samp>Object and links</samp> panel
(<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F7</samp>) (or press
<samp style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl-G</samp>).</li>
  <li>Choose <samp>ADD NEW</samp>.</li>
  <li>Give the new group a name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects that belong to a group are highlighted in green instead of
pink so that you can easily distinguish them.</p>
<h4><a name="group"><font size="+1">v8: </font>Drawing group</a></h4>
<p>You can specify when X-Plane should draw your scenery object relative to
other scenery elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a Blender object of type "Empty" to your scene.</li>
  <li>Add a <a href="#properties">property</a> to the Empty object
named <code>group_terrain</code>, <code>group_beaches</code>, <code>group_shoulders</code>, <code>group_taxiways</code>, <code>group_runways</code>, <code>group_markings</code>, <code>group_airports</code>, <code>group_roads</code>, <code>group_objects</code>, <code>group_light_objects</code> or <code>group_cars</code>.</li>
  <li>Give the property a value between <code>-1</code> and <code>-5</code>
to make X-Plane draw your object before this group,
<code>0</code> to draw your object with this group, or between
<code>1</code> and <code>5</code> to draw your object after this group.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>eg</i> to make X-Plane draw your object at the same time that it
draws runway markings add a property named <code>group_markings</code>
to an Empty object and give it the value <code>0</code>.</p>
<h4><font size="+1">v8: </font>Slung load weight</h4>
<p>You can specify the weight of an object for use in X-Plane's physics
engine if the object is being carried by a plane or helicopter:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a Blender object of type "Empty" to your scene.</li>
  <li>Add a <a href="#properties">property</a> to the Empty object
named <code>slung_load_weight</code> and specify the weight in pounds.
</ul>
<h3>Optimising for X-Plane</h3>
<h4><a name="strips"><font size="+1">v7: </font>Strips</a></h4>
<p>As well as basic 3- and 4-edged faces ("<code>tri</code>"s
and "<code>quad</code>"s), X-Plane v7 objects support two
compound types - "<code>tri_fan</code>" and "<code>quad_strip</code>".
These are strips of two or more tris and quads that share common edges.
Because the faces in these strips share common edges, X-Plane and the
underlying OpenGL renderer have a third or a half as much work to do to
render them compared to individual tris and quads. This gives higher
frame rates.</p>
<p>In order for a pair of faces to be considered for inclusion in
one of these strips, the following conditions need to be true:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The faces must be facing the same way.</li>
  <li>Each pair of faces must share a common edge (apart from the first and last face).</li>
  <li>Each shared edge must have the same texture co-ordinates in both faces.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice this means that the texture must be reversed in
alternate faces in the strip. In the case of tris this can also be
achieved by mapping a single area of the texture across all the tris,
with the tip of the tris at the centre of the texture area. Use
<samp>UVs&nbsp;&rarr; Copy&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Paste</samp> from the
<samp>UV/Image Editor</samp> window to automate the creation of strips.</p>
<p>These compound types aren't supported directly by Blender.
However, the export script automatically tries to spot when it can use
them.</p>
<p><samp style="font-weight: bold;">v8 & csl: </samp>The
performance gains from using strips are more modest in X-Plane v8
and for CSL objects.
These compound types aren't supported in v8 objects (X-Plane v8 uses
more advanced techniques) and the only saving from using strips over
some other UV mapping methods is in reduced "vertex count". It probably
isn't worth going out of your way to look for opportunities of making
strips.</p>
<h4><a name="Level_Of_Detail"></a>Level Of
Detail</h4>
<p>X-Plane has borrowed the concept of "Level Of Detail" from 3D
games. This works on the principle that when you're viewing an object
from a large distance it can be displayed with reduced detail without you
noticing the difference. By displaying distant objects with reduced detail
we can simulate a more complex scene than would be possible if all
objects were drawn at maximum detail.</p>
<p>Use Layers to draw scenery and CSLs (but not Cockpits or Misc Objects) with
multiple Levels Of Detail. Objects in layers 1-3 are visible in X-Plane
at the following distances:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<table style="text-align: left;" border="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-decoration: underline;">Layer</td>
      <th></th>
      <th style="text-decoration: underline;">Distance</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>&lt; 1000m</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">2</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>1000-4000m</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">3</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>4000m-10000m</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
<h3>Blender tips</h3>
<p>Blender has a quirky user interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By default, Right mouse button does what you would expect
Left mouse button to do. I strongly recommend that you change this;
drag down the top menubar to reveal the <samp>User Preferences</samp>
window, select the <samp>View &amp; Controls </samp>tab and choose
<samp>Select with: Left Mouse</samp>.
See <a href="http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/hangar_tutorial/1-setup.html#prefs">this tutorial</a> for a fuller explanation.</li>
  <li>Space does what you might expect Right mouse button to do.</li>
  <li>The user interface is "modal". Buttons and keys do
different things depending on whether you are in "Object", "Edit",
"UV Face Select" or "Pose" mode. (And I thought modal UIs went out with
"vi"). Tab changes mode.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Auto-saving</h4>
<p>Blender can automatically archive old copies of your
<code>.blend</code> files when you save. This is useful if you later want
to revert to an older version.
In the <samp>User Preferences</samp> window, on the
<samp>Auto Save</samp> tab, choose the number of <samp>Save Versions</samp>.
The older versions of your file will be called <code>.blend1</code>,
<code>.blend2</code> etc.</p>
<p>Blender can also periodically save a copy of your work in case Blender
or your computer crashes, or in case you quit Blender without saving.
On the <samp>Auto Save</samp> tab press <samp>Auto Save Temp Files</samp>.
Also, on the <samp>File Paths</samp> tab, ensure that <samp>Temp</samp>
is set to a folder that exists on your machine. This is where the
auto-saved files will be created.
(The default value of <code>/tmp</code> is fine for Mac and Linux,
but <code>/tmp</code> doesn't exist on most Windows machines so
you should change this setting).</p>
<h4><a name="properties">Properties</a></h4>
<p>"Properties" are used to specify <a href="#animation">animation</a>
parameters, <a href="#lamps">"named" lights</a> and the
<a href="#group">drawing group</a>. You can see an object's properties by
selecting it and pressing <samp style="font-weight: bold;">F4</samp> to display
the <samp>Logic</samp> panel. Press the <samp>Add Property</samp> to create
a new property.</p>
<p>Each
property has three fields; Type, Name and Value. If you want to supply a
non-numeric value, <i>eg</i> the name of a "named" light, you'll first need
to change the Type from <samp>Float</samp> to <samp>String</samp>.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<h4>Import object</h4>
<ul>
  <li><code>smoke_black</code> and <code>smoke_white</code>
X-Plane primitives are ignored.</li>
  <li><code>ambient</code>, <code>blend</code> and
<code>specular</code> attributes are ignored.</li>
  <li>The importer usually can't work out which faces are
partially or wholly transparent. You should tell Blender which
faces are transparent using the <samp>Alpha</samp>
button in <samp>UV Face Select</samp> mode after import.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Import plane</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Importing planes made with PlaneMaker 7.30 or earlier is not
supported. Convert an older plane to v7 by opening it in PlaneMaker
7.63 and re-saving it.</li>
  <li>Wings are simplified to reduce polygon count. Any wing
curvature <small>(<i>ie</i> the <samp>customize
chords</samp> option in PlaneMaker)</small> is ignored.</li>
  <li>Adjacent wing segments may not be exactly joined-up.
If not corrected manually this can create shadow effects in
XSquawkBox and X-IvAp.</li>
  <li>Cockpit objects are ignored. You can use
<samp>File&nbsp;&rarr; Import&nbsp;&rarr; X-Plane&nbsp;Object</samp>
to import cockpits.</li>
  <li>Planes (and their weapons, misc objects and cockpit objects)
use multiple texture files. These are not automagically merged
into one file during the import.</li>
  <li>The importer can't work out which faces are partially or
wholly transparent. You should tell Blender which faces are transparent
by pressing the <samp>Alpha</samp> button in <samp>UV
Face Select</samp> mode after import.</li>
  <li>LOD algorithm can be insufficiently aggressive in layer 2.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Export object</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Only Lamps and Mesh Faces (including "lines") are exported.</li>
  <li>All faces must share a single texture file apart from cockpit panel
faces which can additionally use the cockpit panel texture
(this is a limitation of the X-Plane <code>.obj</code> file formats).
You can use
<samp>Image&nbsp;&rarr; Consolidate&nbsp;into&nbsp;one&nbsp;image</samp>
to merge multiple texture files into one file.</li>
</ul>
