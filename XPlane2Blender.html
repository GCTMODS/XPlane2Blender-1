<h2>Scenery &amp; Cockpit import/export scripts for Blender</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.blender3d.org/">Blender</a>is
an open source 3D
object editor for Windows, Mac and UNIX. These Blender scripts export
scenery created in Blender to X-Plane v7 or v8
<code>.obj</code> format for placement with World-Maker.
The scripts also
import existing X-Plane v6, v7 and v8 <code>.obj</code>
scenery files and X-Plane v7 and v8 <code>.acf</code>
airplanes into Blender. All X-Plane scenery primitives are supported
apart from <code>smoke_black</code> and <code>smoke_white</code>
and material attributes.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Requires Windows 98 or later, Mac OS X 10.3 or later, or some
version(?) of Linux.</p>
<p>Requires <a href="http://www.blender3d.org/Download/">Blender</a>
2.34 or later. Requires <a href="http://www.blender3d.org/Download/">Blender</a>
2.40 or later to export objects using animation.</p>
<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>(Re)start Blender.This file can be viewed by choosing <samp>Help
-&gt; X-Plane</samp> in Blender.</p>
<p>On Mac OS, also run the "Console" application that comes with
Mac OS X and which is found under "Utilities".</p>
<p>You can now delete the temporary folder.</p>
<h3>Importing objects</h3>
<p><samp>File -&gt; Import -&gt; X-Plane Object</samp></p>
<p>Select a <code>.obj</code> file. The scenery is
imported at the "3d Cursor" position. Any problems with the import are
reported in the Console window as lines starting "Warn" or "Error".</p>
<p>The <code>.obj</code> file format doesn't
preserve any information about which primitives belong together in the
same mesh. So the script works quite hard to glue faces together into
meshes for ease and speed of editing in Blender. This means that it can
be <u>very</u> slow to import large scenery. You may find
it helpful to
manually merge some meshes together after importing; in "Object Mode"
select the meshes you want to merge and choose <samp>Space
-&gt; Object
-&gt; Join Objects</samp>.</p>
<p>You can import multiple scenery files and re-export them as a
single file. But note that the X-Plane <code>.obj</code>
scenery file format only supports the use of one texture bitmap, so
you'll have to create a single larger texture bitmap file containg all
required textures. Use <samp>UVs -&gt; Double bitmap size</samp>
from the <samp>UV/Image Editor</samp> window to fix up
texture mappings.</p>
<h3>Importing planes</h3>
<p><samp>File -&gt; Import -&gt;
X-Plane plane as scenery</samp></p>
<p>Select a <code>.acf</code> file. The plane is
imported with its reference point at the "3d Cursor" position. Any
problems with the import will be reported in the Console window as
lines starting "Warn" or "Error".</p>
<p>The script creates three versions of the plane in Blender, one
in each of layers 1, 2 and 3, at three levels of detail. See <a href="#Level_Of_Detail">Level of Detail</a> below.</p>
<p>The imported plane needs some tweaking before you can export
it as scenery; see <a href="#Tweaking_planes">Tweaking
planes</a> below.</p>
<h3>Exporting objects</h3>
<samp>File -&gt; Export -&gt; X-Plane v7 Object</samp>
or<br>
<samp>File -&gt; Export -&gt; X-Plane v8 Object</samp>
<p>The output filename and location is the same as the current
Blender filename, but with a <code>.obj</code> extension.
Always check the Console window for messages reporting any problems
with the export, which are displayed as lines starting "Warn" or
"Error".</p>
<p><samp><span style="font-weight: bold;">v8: </span></samp>Note
that v8 objects are only supported by X-Plane versions 8.20 and later.</p>
<h3>Using Blender to create X-Plane objects</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<h4>Lamps</h4>
<ul>
  <li>R,G,B settings are exported to X-Plane. All other settings
(including "Energy") are ignored.</li>
  <li>Only Lamps of type "Lamp" are exported to X-Plane. Lamps of
types "Area", "Spot", "Semi" and "Hemi" are ignored.</li>
  <li>Lamps with certain words in their names have special
behaviours when exported to X-Plane:
    <dl>
      <dd><code>Flash</code> - Light flashes.</dd>
      <dd><code>Pulse</code> - Red pulsing light.
(R,G,B settings in Blender are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>Strobe</code> - White strobe light.
(R,G,B settings in Blender are ignored).</dd>
      <dd><code>Traffic</code> - Cycles red, orange,
green. (R,G,B settings in Blender are ignored).</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Meshes"></a>Meshes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create faces with 3 or 4 edges (called "<code>tri</code>"s
and "<code>quad</code>"s in X-Plane).</li>
  <li>In the <samp>Link and Materials</samp> panel:
    <ul>
      <li><samp>Set Smooth</samp> and <samp>Set
Solid</samp> control whether to smooth edges of faces in a mesh.
This is useful when using multiple faces to simulate a curved surface.
Go to "Object Mode", select the mesh and press <samp>Set Smooth</samp>.
The effect is only visible in Blender <samp>3D View</samp>
windows when the <samp>Viewport Shading</samp> button is
set to <samp>Solid</samp> or <samp>Shaded</samp>.</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><samp style="font-weight: bold;">v7: </samp>Only faces that
are part of a Strip (see <a href="#strips">Strips</a>
below) will be smoothed when displayed in X-Plane.</div>
  </li>
  <li>In the <samp>Texture Face</samp> panel
(available in <samp>UV Face Select</samp> mode):
    <ul>
      <li><samp>Tex</samp> button controls whether
the face has a texture. Create a <code>.bmp</code>or <code>.png
        </code>file in an image editor and save it in the <code>custom
object textures </code>folder. Height and width must be powers
of two (eg 256, 512, etc) but the bitmap doesn't have to be square.
Draw all the textures required by the scenery onto it. Areas of the
texture that are coloured magenta or that have Alpha transparency (png
files only) will be transparent when displayed in X-Plane. Use the <samp>UV
Image Editor</samp> window to control mapping of the texture
bitmap to the face.</li>
      <li><samp>Tiles</samp> button controls whether
the face is rendered with "polygon offsetting" (poly_os) in X-Plane.
Use this for faces that lie horizontally on the ground to prevent
artifacts in X-Plane.Don't press this button for other faces.</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><samp style="font-weight: bold;">v7: </samp>This button is
ignored since "polygon offsetting" produces artifacts in X-Plane v7 and
early versions of X-Plane v8.</div>
    <ul>
      <li><samp>Collision</samp> button indicates
that the face is <u>not</u> "hard" (ie not "landable on")
in X-Plane.
Making faces hard is very expensive, so this button should normally
be pressed. Unpress this button only for things like helicopter
landing pads. <small>(Note: The meaning of this button was
changed in v1.50. Use <a href="http://www.marginal.dsl.pipex.com/x-planescenery/collide.txt">this</a>
script to turn the Collision button back on for all faces).</small>
        <div style="margin-left: 0px;"><samp style="font-weight: bold;">v7: </samp>Only faces with
4
edges (ie "<code>quad</code>"s) are exported as "hard".</div>
        <div style="margin-left: 0px;"><samp style="font-weight: bold;">v7: </samp>X-Plane
versions
prior to 8.20 have a bug where <code>.obj </code>files
that contain hard faces must be placed in WorldMaker with an "object
heading" of 0. Otherwise the "hard" part of the surface ends up in the
wrong place.</div>
      </li>
      <li><samp>Twoside</samp> button controls
whether one or both sides of the face are displayed. Using a two-sided
face is more expensive than using a single-sided face, but is cheaper
and easier than using two single-sided faces back-to-back.</li>
      <li><samp>Alpha</samp> button is a hint to
Blender and to X-Plane that the face is transparent. Use this for
transparent faces to prevent artifacts when displayed in X-Plane. Don't
press this button for opaque (normal) faces.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The export script will change the order of faces in the output
file to optimise for rendering speed and to ensure that faces with
alpha are tendered after opaque faces. It will preserve the relative
order of faces that have the same <samp>Link and Materials</samp>
and<samp>Texture Face</samp> settings as each other.</p>
<p>Use <a href="http://www.marginal.dsl.pipex.com/x-planescenery/normalise.txt">this</a>
script if you need to reset all faces in the scene to standard settings
<small>(<i>ie</i> smooth, no polygon offsetting, not
hard, single sided,
not transparent)</small>.</p>
<h4>Lines</h4>
<p>Blender doesn't support Lines directly. Use a mesh with one
4-edged face instead. The pair of vertices at each end of the "line"
must be within 0.1 units of each other. The face must be the only face
in its mesh and must not have a texture assigned to it.</p>
<p>To colour the "line", assign a Material to the face and set
the Material's <samp>Basic Colour</samp> RGB values. Faces
not linked to a Material will be exported coloured grey.</p>
<h4><font size="+1">v8: </font>Animation</h4>
<p>You can make lamps, meshes and lines animate in X-Plane
according to the value of any of the "int" or "float" internal
simulator datarefs listed <a href="http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.html">here</a>. In practice, the useful datarefs mostly have
units of "bool" or "ratio".</p>
<p>Create an "Armature" object, with one or more "Bones". Name
the bone(s) with one of the datarefs in the <a href="http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.html">list</a>.
For datarefs that are shown as <code>float[<i>n</i>]</code>
in the list, append <code>[0]</code> to the name to use
the first value, <code>[1]</code> to use the second value
etc. <i>eg</i> name the bone <code>ENGN_thro[0]</code>
to represent the throttle setting for the first engine. Add additional
bones to the armature and create parent/child relationships between
each bone (in <samp>Edit Mode</samp>) if you need to use
multiple datarefs to describe the animation of a single lamp or mesh.</p>
<p>Parent the lamp or mesh that you want to animate to the bone
(choose the "youngest" child bone in the chain if you're using multiple
datarefs):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the lamp or mesh</li>
  <li>Shift-click on the Armature</li>
  <li>Choose <samp>Pose Mode</samp> from the Mode
menu</li>
  <li>Click on the bone</li>
  <li>Press <samp style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl-P</samp>
and select <samp>Bone</samp> from the popup menu</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <samp>Pose Mode</samp> to describe the
animation; insert keys in Blender's frames 1 and 2 to represent the
desired position of the mesh at the minimum and maximum dataref values
respectively. <small>(X-Plane's animation syntax is quite
simple; so don't use IPOcurves or any other advanced Blender animation
techniques since these will be ignored by the exporter - only the
positions in frames 1 and 2 are exported to X-Plane).</small></p>
<p>By default, the minimum and maximum dataref values are 0 and 1
respectively. You can change the values by adding properties in the <samp>Logic</samp>
panel (<samp style="font-weight: bold;">F4</samp>);
name the property after the dataref and append <code>_v1</code>
to the name for the minimum value or <code>_v2</code> for
the maximum value. <i>eg</i> the yoke pitch dataref <code>yolk_pitch_ratio</code>
has values between -1 (forward) and +1 (back) in X-Plane; so to get
X-Plane to use the correct minimum dataref value for the animation add
a property called <code>yolk_pitch_ratio_v1</code> and
give it the value -1.</p>
<h3>Creating X-Plane scenery</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Find and open the <code>Custom&nbsp;Scenery</code>
folder inside your <code>X-Plane</code> or <code>X-System</code>
nnn installation (where nnn is the version number of your version of
X-Plane - eg <code>X-System 763</code>).</li>
  <li>Create a subfolder with the name of the scenery collection
that you're making.</li>
  <li>Open the new folder.</li>
  <li>Create two new subfolders, called <code>custom&nbsp;objects</code>
and <code>custom&nbsp;object&nbsp;textures</code>
(these names must be spelt correctly).</li>
  <li>Save your Blender file in the <code>custom&nbsp;objects</code>
folder with a descriptive name, <i>eg</i>:
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>X-System&nbsp;nnn\Custom&nbsp;Scenery\EGLL\custom&nbsp;objects\house.blend</code></div>
The X-Plane <code>.obj</code> file will be exported to the
same place, <i>ie</i>:
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>X-System&nbsp;nnn\Custom&nbsp;Scenery\EGLL\custom
objects\house.obj</code></div>
  </li>
  <li>Use Lamps and Meshes to construct your scenery. No other
Blender object types are exported.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="Tweaking_planes"></a>Tweaking
planes</h4>
<p>Imported planes need some tweaking to be positioned correctly
on the ground:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Select layers 1-3, select all objects and position the
plane so that its undercarriage is sitting directly on the ground
(represented by the <i>x</i>/y axes).</li>
  <li>You may also need to rotate the plane slightly so that all
wheels are level; press <samp style="font-weight: bold;">r</samp>
and move the mouse to <u>r</u>otate the plane so that its
undercarriage is sitting directly on the ground.
Click to set the plane's position.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main texture bitmap file is named <code><i>airplane</i>_paint</code>.
Most planes also use textures from a second bitmap file named <code><i>airplane</i>_paint2</code>.
If your imported plane uses weapons then each weapon will also use an
additional bitmap file. However the X-Plane <code>.obj</code>
scenery file formats only support the use of a single texture bitmap
file. Meshes that use textures from an additional bitmap file are
imported with "<code>*</code>" after their name.</p>
<p>Open an <samp>Outliner</samp> window, and for
each listed mesh that has a name ending with "<code>*</code>",
either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete the mesh,</li>
  <li>Or copy the required textures to an unused area in <code><i>airplane</i>_paint</code>,
and use the <samp>UV Image Editor</samp> window to map the
new textures in <code><i>airplane</i>_paint</code>
to the mesh's faces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider performance issues when the plane is rendered in
X-Plane. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Most important: Do you really need fully detailed 1024x1024
textures for your static plane? Video memory is used up by terrain and
object textures. Once you run out of video memory the GPU has to fall
back to main memory, and this <u>really</u> slows things
down. One 1024x1024 texture uses 4MB of video memory. Some people are
running X-Plane on computers with only 32MB of video memory, so one
1024x1024 texture at highest resolution uses 1/8th of it. Consider
resizing the texture bitmap file in an image editor to 512x512 or even
256x256. Use <samp>Image -&gt; Replace</samp> to use
the new texture bitmap file.</li>
  <li>Does the model have hidden faces? Some versions of X-Plane
don't handle hidden faces in v7 scenery objects very well and they also
a cause a small performance hit. Look for things like wings or misc
bodies that are partially or wholly buried in the fuselage and delete
any wholly hidden faces before exporting.</li>
  <li>Do you really need all that detail? Consider deleting
details like flap tracks, antennae etc before exporting. This
especially goes for the lower <a href="XPlane2Blender.html#Level_Of_Detail">Level of Detail</a>
versions of the plane in layers 2 and 3 which are only viewed in
X-Plane from &gt;1000m and &gt;4000m respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating 3D cockpits</h3>
<p>X-Plane 3D cockpits are just normal v7 or v8 scenery objects.
However cockpits can't contain multiple <a href="#Level_Of_Detail">Levels
of Detail</a>, so only objects in Blender layer 1 are exported.
If you want to keep objects in your Blender scene for reference but
which you don't want to export - eg the plane fuselage - then put them
in layer 4 or greater before exporting.</p>
<p>Choose <samp>File-&gt;Save As</samp> and save
the blender file in the same folder as your plane's <code>.acf</code>
file with the name <code><i>airplane</i>_cockpit.blend</code>,
where <i>airplane</i> is the name of your plane's <code>.acf</code>
file.</p>
<p>Normally you will want to import your plane into Blender to
act as a reference and/or starting point for your cockpit. Delete any
plane parts that you don't need in creating your cockpit - you only
need to keep the fuselage itself plus any relevant Misc Bodies. After
import, your cockpit uses the same texture file as your plane, ie <code><i>airplane</i>_paint</code>.
Choose <samp>Image -&gt; Replace </samp> in a <samp>UV
Image Editor</samp> window to use a different texture file, which
can be named anything you like but which should live in the same folder
as your plane's <code>.acf</code> file.</p>
<p>To construct moving cockpit instruments in X-Plane v8:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Layout the 2D panel in PlaneMaker as normal. But bear in
mind that only the top 768 lines of the 2D panel can be used in the 3D
cockpit in X-Plane versions prior to 8.20. This is fixed in X-Plane
v8.20.</li>
  <li>Run X-Plane and load your aircraft. Press the <samp style="font-weight: bold;">Up</samp> arrow to ensure
that you're looking at the top of the 2D panel. Take a screenshot (on a
PC press <samp style="font-weight: bold;">Alt&nbsp;PrtSc</samp>).</li>
  <li>Load the screenshot into an image editor and change its
size so that it's the same size as your 2D panel (typically 1024x1024)
- don't resize the screenshot, just add blank space. Save the
screenshot as <code>ScreenshotPanel.png</code> (or any
filename ending in <code>*panel.*</code>) in the same
folder as your plane's <code>.acf</code> file.</li>
  <li>Use the <code>ScreenshotPanel.png</code>texture
on those faces that you want to display moving cockpit instruments in
X-Plane. (It's easier to use this screenshot texture instead of the
real panel texture while editing in Blender, since the screenshot has
instruments drawn on it). The screenshot file does not need to be
distributed with your finished plane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that X-Plane versions prior to 8.20 only display the 3D
cockpit when running at the default 1024x768 resolution. You may want
to mention this in the Readme with your plane if your plane works with
X-Plane versions prior to 8.20. This is fixed in X-Plane v8.20.</p>
<h3>Optimising for X-Plane</h3>
<h4><a name="strips"></a><font size="+1">v7:
</font>Strips</h4>
<p>As well as basic 3- and 4-edged faces ("<code>tri</code>"s
and "<code>quad</code>"s), X-Plane v7 objects support two
compound types - "<code>tri_fan</code>" and "<code>quad_strip</code>".
These are strips of two or more tris and quads that share common edges.
Because the faces in these strips share common edges, X-Plane and the
underlying OpenGL renderer have a third or a half as much work to do to
render them compared to individual tris and quads. This gives higher
frame rates.</p>
<p>In order for a pair of faces to be considered for inclusion in
one of these strips, the following conditions need to be true:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The faces must be facing the same way.</li>
  <li>Each pair of faces must share a common edge (apart from the
first and last face).</li>
  <li>Each shared edge must have the same texture bitmap
co-ordinates in both faces.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice this means that the texture must be reversed in
alternate faces in the strip. In the case of tris this can also be
achieved by mapping a single area of the texture across all the tris,
with the tip of the tris at the centre of the texture area. Use <samp>UVs
-&gt; Copy &amp; Paste</samp> from the<samp>
UV/Image Editor</samp> window to automate the creation of strips.</p>
<p>These compound types aren't supported directly by Blender.
However, the export script automatically tries to spot when it can use
them.</p>
<p><samp style="font-weight: bold;">v8: </samp>These
compound types aren't supported in v8 objects. X-Plane uses more
efficient techniques in v8 objects.</p>
<h4><a name="Level_Of_Detail"></a>Level Of
Detail</h4>
<p>X-Plane has borrowed the concept of "Level Of Detail" from 3D
games. This works on the principle that objects can be drawn with less
detail when you're viewing them from a large distance.</p>
<p>Use Layers to draw scenery with multiple Levels Of Detail.
Objects in layers 1-3 are visible in X-Plane at the following distances:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

<h3>Blender tips</h3>
<p>Blender has a quirky user interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By default, Right mouse button does what you would expect
Left mouse button to do. I strongly recommend that you change this;
drag down the top menubar to reveal the User Preferences window, select
the <samp>View &amp; Controls </samp>tab and choose <samp>Select
with: Left Mouse</samp>. See <a href="http://www.marginal.dsl.pipex.com/x-planescenery/hangar_tutorial/1-setup.html#prefs">
this tutorial</a> for a fuller explanation.</li>
  <li>Space does what you might expect Right mouse button to do.</li>
  <li>The user interface is "modal". Buttons and keys do
different things depending on whether you are in "Object", "Edit" or
"UV Face Select" mode. (And I thought modal UIs went out with "vi").
Tab changes mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<h4>Import object</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Animation is not supported.</li>
  <li><code>smoke_black</code> and <code>smoke_white</code>
X-Plane primitives are ignored.</li>
  <li><code>poly_os</code>, <code>ambient</code>,
    <code>difuse</code>, <code>specular</code>,
    <code>emission</code> and <code>shiny</code>
attributes are ignored.</li>
  <li>The importer usually can't work out which faces are
partially or wholly transparent. You should tell Blender which faces
are transparent faces by pressing the <samp>Alpha</samp>
button in <samp>UV Face Select</samp> mode after import.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Import plane</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Importing v8.20 planes is not yet supported. v7.40 to v8.17
planes should work fine.</li>
  <li>Cockpits objects are ignored. You can use <samp>File
-&gt; Import -&gt; X-Plane Object</samp> to import
cockpits.</li>
  <li>Planes (and their weapons) can use multiple texture bitmap
files. These are not automagically merged into one file during the
import.</li>
  <li>The importer can't work out which faces are partially or
wholly transparent. You should tell Blender which faces are transparent
faces by pressing the <samp>Alpha</samp> button in <samp>UV
Face Select</samp> mode after import.</li>
  <li>LOD algorithm can be too conservative in layer 2.</li>
  <li>v6 planes are not supported. Convert a v6 plane to v7 by
opening it in PlaneMaker 7.40 or later and re-saving it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Export object</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Only Lamps and Mesh Faces (including "lines") are exported.</li>
  <li>All faces must share a single texture bitmap file (this is
a limitation of the X-Plane <code>.obj</code> file
formats) apart from cockpit panel faces which can additionally use the
cockpit panel bitmap file. Multiple textures are not automagically
merged into one file during the export.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p><a href="mailto:Jonathan%20Harris%20%3Cx-plane@marginal.org.uk%3E">Mail
me</a> with any questions, problems etc.</p>
<p>If reporting a problem, please:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, check that you are using the latest version of the
scripts.</li>
  <li>Try to send me the the <code>.obj</code>, <code>.acf</code>
or <code>.blend</code> file (where relevant) and the
contents of the Console window. <small>(In Mac OS X, this is the
"Console" program. In Windows this the window titled "Blender" that
looks like a Command Prompt).</small></li>
